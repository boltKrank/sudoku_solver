To translate this into input, we just need to input the numbers seperated by comma as a parameter. Semi-colon to terminate.

The above will become:

2,8,0,4,5,0,6,0,0,0,5,0,6,9,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,1,8,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,7,2,0,9,0,1,0,5,6,0,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,2,0,6,0,0,4,9,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,1,5,0,6,0,0,0,3,0,7,6,0,2,1;
